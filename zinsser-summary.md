# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Cory Mortimer

In chapter two of Zinsser's book, he wrote about simplicity and how the writer confuses the reader by using different tenses, incoherent thoughts, and ambiguity. People have a limited attention span so these things get in the way of the reader's understanding. To write simply, one needs to state their point precisely. Chapter three is about clutter. Clutter is the extra words we add to overly-describe words and the ambiguous terms that make people seem sophisticated. To write without clutter, one can find the words that do not add to the idea and cut them.
